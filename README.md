This codebase is fully functional and is designed to operate with datasets accessed via the Open Neurophysiology Environment (ONE). The corresponding datasets will be made available through ONE and uploaded at a later date.

The notebooks here utilize separate conda environments that were validated on Ubuntu 22.04
* [2025AgingPaperFigures.ipynb](2025AgingPaperFigures.ipynb) uses a python 3.8 conda enviroment with one/ibl dependencies, see [conda-envs/hwanglab.yaml](conda-envs/hwanglab.yaml).
* [JEDI_dataProcessing.ipynb](JEDI_dataProcessing.ipynb) uses a python 3.11 conda environment with caiman dependencies, see [conda-envs/caiman.yaml](conda-envs/caiman.yaml).
